# Assignment-1.4
Ques 1. Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail?

ANSWER:
I.)VOLUME : It describes the size of data.there will be a huge pile of data stored by each individual.
II.)VELOCITY : the speed at which data is generated and retrived from a huge amount of data.
III.)VARIETY : the data stored will be in various form like image,PDF etc.which will not be alike the management of those irrelevant data
              refers to variety.
IV.)VERACITY : Big Data Veracity refers to the biases, noise and abnormality in data. Is the data that is being stored
              veracity in data analysis is the biggest challenge. 
V.)VALUE: The costs of compute, storage, and connectivity resources are plunging, and new technologies like scanners, smartphones, 
          ubiquitous video, and other data-collectors mean that there is a huge volumes of data  what was available even five 
          to 10 years ago.We capture every mouse click, phone call, text message, Web search, transaction, and more. As the volume 
          of data grows, we can learn more – but only if we uncover the meaningful relationships and patterns.
              
              
Ques 2.Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data?   
 ANSWER :
 There are two posssible solutions :
 1. Scale Up :
• Increase the configuration of a single system, like disk capacity, RAM, data transfer
speed, etc.
• Complex, costly, and a time consuming process.
2. Scale Out :
• Use multiple commodity (economical) machines and distribute the load of
  storage/processing among them
• Economical and quick to implement as it focuses on distribution of load
• Instead of having a single system with 10 TB of storage and 80 GB of RAM, use 40
  machines with 256 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM.
    

Ques 3. Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out?
ANSWER: 
SCALE UP: Scale-up can solve a capacity problem without adding infrastructure elements such as network connectivity. However, it does
require additional space, power, and cooling. Scaling up does not add controller capabilities to handle additional host activities.
That means it doesn’t add costs for extra control functions either.
So the costs have not scaled at the same rate for the initial storage system plus storage devices – only additional devices have been
added.
 
SCALE OUT : Scale-out storage usually requires additional storage (called nodes) to add capacity and performance. Or in the case of 
monolithic storage systems, it scales by adding more functional elements (usually controller cards).One difference between scaling
out and just putting more storage systems on the floor is that scale-out storage continues to be represented as a single system.
